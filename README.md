# HR DATA ANALYTICS DASHBOARD - POWER BI PROJECT
## Project Objective
This project involves building an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to uncover insights related to employee attrition, job satisfaction, and demographics. The purpose is to help HR professionals and decision-makers identify key trends and potential problem areas that impact employee retention.
## Objectives
1 - Analyze and visualize employee attrition patterns.
2 - Identify department-wise and education field-wise attrition rates.
3 - Explore how gender, age group, and job satisfaction affect attrition.
4 - Present insights in an intuitive, interactive Power BI dashboard.
## Key Features
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
* Attrition by Gender - Comparison of attrition rates among male and female employees.
* Department-wise Attrition - Breakdown of attrition percentages across departments (e.g., Sales, R&D, HR).
* Number of Employees by Age Group - Distribution of employees across different age brackets.
* Job Satisfaction Ratings - Analysis of employee satisfaction scores and their relation to attrition.
* Education Field-wise Attrition - Attrition patterns across various education backgrounds.
* Attrition by Gender and Age Group - Combined analysis to see how gender and age jointly impact attrition rates.
