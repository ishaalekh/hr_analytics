# HR DATA ANALYTICS DASHBOARD - POWER BI PROJECT
## Project Objective
This project involves building an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to uncover insights related to employee attrition, job satisfaction, and demographics. The purpose is to help HR professionals and decision-makers identify key trends and potential problem areas that impact employee retention.
## Objectives
* Analyze and visualize employee attrition patterns.
* Identify department-wise and education field-wise attrition rates.
* Explore how gender, age group, and job satisfaction affect attrition.
* Present insights in an intuitive, interactive Power BI dashboard.
## Key Features
The dashboard includes the following visualizations:
* Attrition by Gender - Comparison of attrition rates among male and female employees.
* Department-wise Attrition - Breakdown of attrition percentages across departments (e.g., Sales, R&D, HR).
* Number of Employees by Age Group - Distribution of employees across different age brackets.
* Job Satisfaction Ratings - Analysis of employee satisfaction scores and their relation to attrition.
* Education Field-wise Attrition - Attrition patterns across various education backgrounds.
* Attrition by Gender and Age Group - Combined analysis to see how gender and age jointly impact attrition rates.
## Tools and Technologies
* Power BI Desktop – For data visualization and dashboard development
* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For calculated columns and measures
* Power Query – For data transformation and cleaning

## Process
Imported HR data into Power BI and performed initial analysis to understand key metrics. Cleaned and transformed data using Power Query by adding conditional columns, creating measures (total employees, attrition rate, etc.), and deriving new fields like age groups. Analyzed correlations between attrition and factors like age, department, gender, and job satisfaction. Built an interactive dashboard with cards, charts, and tables for clear insights. Finalized by testing accuracy and dashboard performance.

## Final Conclusion
The HR Analytics Dashboard provides valuable insights into the current workforce and attrition patterns across the organization. Key highlights from the dashboard are:
* Total Employees: 1,470, with an active workforce of 1,233.
* Attrition: 237 employees left the organization, resulting in an attrition rate of 16.12%.
* Average Age: 37 years, with most employees falling in the 25-34 and 35-44 age groups.
#### Departments Most Affected by Attrition:
* R&D: Highest attrition at 56.12%.
* Sales: 38.82%.
* HR: 5.06%.
#### Education Field Analysis:
* Highest attrition observed among employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds.
#### Gender & Age-Based Attrition:
* Higher attrition rate seen among employees aged 25-34 and under 25, with notable gender differences in some age bands.
#### Job Satisfaction Insights:
* Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician roles show the highest number of employees but also require attention due to mixed satisfaction levels.
* Improvement opportunities in job roles with high attrition and low satisfaction scores.
#### Action Points:
* Focus on retention strategies for R&D and Sales departments.
* Prioritize career development programs for younger employees (under 35).
* Address satisfaction concerns, especially for Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician roles.
* Tailor retention strategies considering education backgrounds prone to attrition.
